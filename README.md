# CISSA FLAPPY BIRD

It is built on top of a basic node server and uses [Mark Steve's](https://github.com/marksteve) [implementation of flapy bird](https://github.com/marksteve/dtmb).

It can be found live at http://cissa-challenge.herokuapp.com/. You can also see the [scoreboard route](http://cissa-challenge.herokuapp.com/scoreboard) & the [admin route](http://cissa-challenge.herokuapp.com/admin)
